FORMULA PARA OUTPUT DE UN CONVOLUTIONAL

We can compute the spatial size of the output volume as a function of the input volume size (WW), the receptive field size of the Conv 
Layer neurons (FF), the stride with which they are applied (SS), and the amount of zero padding used (PP) on the border. 
You can convince yourself that the correct formula for calculating how many neurons “fit” is given by (W−F+2P)/S+1(W−F+2P)/S+1. 
For example for a 7x7 input and a 3x3 filter with stride 1 and pad 0 we would get a 5x5 output. With stride 2 we would get a 3x3 output. 
Lets also see one more graphical example:


Constraints on strides. Note again that the spatial arrangement hyperparameters have mutual constraints. For example, when the input has
size W=10W=10, no zero-padding is used P=0P=0, and the filter size is F=3F=3, then it would be impossible to use stride S=2S=2,
since (W−F+2P)/S+1=(10−3+0)/2+1=4.5(W−F+2P)/S+1=(10−3+0)/2+1=4.5, i.e. not an integer, indicating that the neurons don’t “fit” neatly
and symmetrically across the input. Therefore, this setting of the hyperparameters is considered to be invalid, and a ConvNet library
could throw an exception or zero pad the rest to make it fit, or crop the input to make it fit, or something. As we will see in the
ConvNet architectures section, sizing the ConvNets appropriately so that all the dimensions “work out” can be a real headache, which
the use of zero-padding and some design guidelines will significantly alleviate.
